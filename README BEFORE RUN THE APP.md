First i wanna say thanks for giving me a chance to do the test;

Total working hour = 13 Hour;
Total api route done = 14 route;

Poblem API :
1. Password are hard coded. I can't register with other password. Only 'Pass@w0rd' will works for register
2. Query url GET organizers not working. So pagination can't be done.
3. I can't get all user list, so i don't know which user id can be delete. (Guessing random ID will works)
4. I can't change the password because problem number 1

There are still some imperfections in the API, but it was really nice to be able to do the tests, even if the tests didn't finish well.
